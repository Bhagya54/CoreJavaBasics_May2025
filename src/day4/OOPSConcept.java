		 * OOP: Object Oriented Programming
		 * 1. class and object 
		 * 
		 * 4 pillars
		 * 1.Inheritance : avoid redundancy of code
		 * 2.Polymorphism :
		 * Poly: many
		 * Morphism: forms
		 *   > Method Overloading: with same method name with difference in:
		 *     1. No. of parameters
		 *     2. Datatype of parameters
		 *     implements only within class
		 *   > Method Overriding: when parent class and child class has same
		 *   method with different implementation
		 *   implements through multiple classes - 1 is parent class , 1 is child class
		 * 
		 * 3.Abstraction: hiding the implementation
		 * > Interface
		 *     > all methods are by default abstract(they don't have method implementation)
		 * > Abstract class
		 * 	   > abstract keyword for class as well as for the method
		 * 	   > methods with implementation as well as without implementation.
		 * 
		 * Interface > class : implements
		 * class>class: extends
		 * 
		 * Note: We cannot create object for an interface as well as an abstract class
		 * 4.Encapsulation - hiding the data.
		 * Access Modifier:
		 * private: we can access within the class
		 * read(getter method) and write(setter method)
		 * protected: within the package and outside the package if there
		 * is a inheritance relationship
		 * default: access only within the package
		 * public: access throughtout ur project
		 * 
		 * Inheritance:
		 * inherits something from ancestors
		 * 
		 * Student
		 * attendSession
		 * submitsProject
		 * 
		 * Teacher
		 * conductSession
		 * evaluateProject
		 * 
		 * Staff
		 * evaluateAttendance
		 * calculateSalary
		 * 
		 * 
		 * BaseClass
		 * markAttendance
		 * lunchTime
		 *
